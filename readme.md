## Accessibility Theme Unit Test

This is an XML import file for WordPress. It's a version of the Theme Unit Test data, used for theme reviewing. This copy of the data is created to eliminate issues in the theme unit test data that could generate false positives for accessibility issues and to streamline the data for testing accessibility issues.

## Why?

This exists to help clarify the accessible theme testing process. The standard Theme Unit Test data includes data that will generate accessibility errors, which can create confusion between whether the theme or the content is a problem. In manual testing, this is not a problem, but for automated testing these false positives would remove the benefits of automation.
